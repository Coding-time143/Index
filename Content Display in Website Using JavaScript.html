    <h1>Fun Facts about Rabbits:</h1>
    <h2>🐰A baby rabbit is called a kit, a female is known as a doe, and a male is referred to as a buck!</h2>
    <h2>🐰Rabbits are very social animals that often live in groups. They create complex underground homes called warrens, which consist of a series of tunnels and rooms!</h2>
    <h2>🐰A rabbit's teeth never stop growing!</h2>
    <h2>🐰Their teeth can grow up to 5 inches a year, which is why rabbits need to chew on hay and wooden toys to wear them down and avoid dental problems!</h2>
    <h2>🐰Have you ever seen a rabbit jump and twist in the air? This is called a binky, a sign that a rabbit is happy and playful. Binkies are most common in domestic rabbits, but you might see wild rabbits do it, too!</h2>

      <h1>Fun Facts about Puppies:</h1>
      <h2>🐶Etymologists think the term puppy may come from poupeé, a French word meaning doll or toy. The word puppy doesn't appear to have entered the English language until the late 16th century—before that, English speakers called baby dogs whelps. William Shakespeare's King John, believed to be written in the 1590s, is one of the earliest known works to use the (super cute) term puppy-dog!</h2>
      <h2>🐶Like many newborn mammals, puppies are born completely toothless. At 2 to 4 weeks of age, a puppy's 28 baby teeth will start to come in. Around 12 to 16 weeks old, those baby teeth fall out, and by the time pups are 6 months old, they should be sporting a set of 42 adult teeth!</h2>
      <h2>🐶Like children, puppies need a lot of sleep—up to 15 to 20 hours of it a day. The American Kennel Club strongly advises dog owners to resist the urge to disturb napping puppies, because sleep is critical for a young canine's developing brain, muscles, and immune system. Puppy owners should also establish a designated sleeping space on their pup's behalf so they can snooze undisturbed!</h2>
      <h2>🐶cientists don't know how common identical twin puppies are, because until very recently, no one was able to prove that they existed at all. In 2016, Kurt de Cramer, a South African veterinarian, noticed something unusual while performing a C-section on a pregnant Irish wolfhound. Normally, every puppy gets its own placenta, yet de Cramer noticed that two of the seven pups in this litter shared a single placenta. Testing later verified that the puppies were genetically identical. It was the first confirmed case of identical twin puppies in the world!</h2>
      <h2>🐶Those adorable "puppy eyes" aren't an inadvertent expression of canine emotion; they're a deliberate ploy to get our attention. Puppies (and adult dogs) have learned that raising their eyebrows, which makes their eyes appear bigger and sadder, makes them magnets for human attention. According to one study from 2017, dogs are more likely to make dramatic facial expressions like puppy-dog eyes when they know humans are watching. And it works. Research has shown that shelter puppies who put on such faces get adopted more quickly than dogs that show other behaviors, like wagging their tails!</h2>
